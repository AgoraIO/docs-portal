Hume AI provides emotion-aware text-to-speech technology that generates natural, expressive voices with emotional intelligence. The platform offers both curated voices from the Voice Library and support for custom voice creation, enabling personalized audio experiences.

### Sample configuration

The following example shows a starting `tts` parameter configuration you can use when you [Start a conversational AI agent](../../../api-reference/conversational-ai/rest-api/agent/join.md).

```json
"tts": {
    "vendor": "humeai",
    "params": {
        "key": "",
        "voice_id": "",
        "base_url": "https://api.hume.ai",
        "provider": "HUME_AI",
        "speed": 1,
        "trailing_silence": 0.35
    }
}
```
